By combining daily snapshots, there is a large break/jump in the series from 17th to 18th March 2020. This is likely (the Government of Canada website does not make the reasoning clear, only publishes a slightly different format of table) the result of a large backlog of tests waiting to be processed. This makes the data misleading to use in time-series format prior to 18th March. We therefore only use data from 18th March onwards for comparability."

The dashboard provides daily figures of samples tested per day (and cumulative test numbers on a separate tab). We have copied this time-series as presented in the original source. It's important to note that when figures exceed 1000, the Finnish Department of Health and Welfare report samples to the nearest hundred (e.g. 1.6k). 

From the available documention we cannot be entirely certain whether 'samples tested' refers to the number of tests or number of people tested, given the general ambiguity in the usage of these terms internationally. However, a literal interpretation of the figures as the number of samples tested is consistent with further descriptions of the testing data provided [here](https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/tilannekatsaus-koronaviruksesta).

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day). It is likely this is was the first day, or close to the first day of testing."

The latest update, as of 9th April, was published on the 2nd April. The updates include a figure for the number of tests (‘Nombre de tests’). However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate.

Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests – e.g. both positive – would be added to tests of people who had five tests – e.g. three negative and two positive.

The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. In the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series."

Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 8 April states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 14/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 1,317,887;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 143 labs reported 392,984 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 149 labs reported 360,964 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127457 samples tested.
– For calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 48 labs reported 87,863 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

Figures relate to ‘Tamponi’ (the number of ‘swabs’ tested) conducted in all labs across Italy. This figure is available for each individual region separately at the source indicated. However it appears that data is missing for individual regions for particular dates – we assume that these are also missing from the aggregate total for Italy that we provide. The list of missing data, in English, can be seen at the bottom of [this data dashboard built by Franco Mossotto](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/91350339-2c97-49b5-92b8-965996530f00/page/RdlHB). 

It is clear that there are delays in timeline running up to a test being reported – both in terms of the time it takes for a symptomatic person to receive a test, and in the time for that test to then get reported in the data. For one region, Lombardy, an investigation found the latter delay to be around 3-4 days.

It is unclear whether the figures include tests pending results. But given that the stock of total tests to date is large relative to the daily number of tests, this is unlikely to affect the numbers materially.

There is significant variation in testing practices – in terms of how many tests are conducted and how they are allocated across the population – across regions and these practices have also changed over time.

Pietro Monticone and Riccardo Valperga have written a very helpful and detailed description of these data quality issues [here in GitHub](https://pitmonticone.github.io/covid-italy/owid-testing-italy.html)."

Daily changes in the number of people tested are included in parentheses. For the 3rd April, the daily changes do not reconcile with the cumulative totals. Moreover, it is clear that revisions to past data are simply added to the new cumulative total, making the time series of 'daily tests' too erratic to be published.

This includes two cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19/03 and (2) 25/03. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote.

It isn't clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 Feb when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to the 10 Feb, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port. We do not report these numbers in the time series as it is unclear how they relate to the cumulative totals.

Rather than providing a full time series, each release provides daily test figures for a handful of the most recent days and then shows the cumulative total prior to that. It appears that figures are retrospectively updated, because the chain of daily figures from previous releases does not perfectly agree with the cumulative total reported in subsequent releases (though the discrepancies are relatively small).

Available to us are those reports retrievable through Web Archive. The earliest is from 26 March. A report for everyday since then could not be retreived. We construct our series taking the cumulative total as reported in the most recent report, and adding the daily figures available in the most recent report. The daily tesing figures we provide are calculated based on the change in the this cumulative figure we contruct. As such they may disagree slightly with the figures published in earlier releases.

The source reports the number of labs reporting in a given daily or cumulative figure. These have varied over the course of the reports, and this will affect the consistency of the time series we present.

The earliest figure we have is a cumulative total (reported on the 26 March) for the 14 March. The release states that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March report these data daily.' The figure given notes that 24 labs were counted in this cumulative figure. More recent releases count around 35 labs in the cumulative totals provided. But there appear to be reporting lags – the number of labs reporting for the latest one or two days are a good deal lower than for previous days.

The latest available virological daily report we have found provides testing figures up to 7 April 2020. We check for updates daily and have not been able to find more recent testing figures on the source website."

We assume that the figures provided refer to the same units over time, but we are uncertain whether the units are the number of tests performed or the number of people tested.

The report published on 7 April states up to week 14 (ending 5 March)
- A total of 54,700 individuals have been analyzed.
- During week 14, 17,700 individuals were analyzed.
- During week 13, 12,300 individuals were analyzed.
- During week 12, 10,300 individuals were analyzed.
- During week 11, 9,000 individuals' samples were.
- During week 10, 4,300 individuals were analyzed.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we can retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week:
- By 5 April: 54700 total people tested;
- By 29 March: 54700 - 17700 = 37000 people tested;
- By 22 March: 37000 – 12300 = 24700 people tested;
- By 15 March: 24700 – 10300 = 14400 people tested;
- By 8 March: 14400 – 9000 = 5400 people tested;
- By 1 March: 5400 – 4300 = 1100 people tested.

Taiwan - tests performed,2020-04-14,http://at.cdc.tw/7IUu7Y,Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC),,49748,2.089,1199,0.05,1067,0.045,Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov.tw/en,"The figures are labelled in the source only as 'tested'. It is unclear whether this relates to the number of individuals tested, or the number of samples tested.","The Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) host a dashboard in which they publish the total 'tested' to date, and 'new from yesterday'. It is not clear whether this represents the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested. The number 'tested' is greater than the sum of confirmed cases and 'excluded' (i.e. negative) test results. This would suggest it does not equal the total number of people tested, or if it does, pending results without a reported outcome are also included.

Although the CDC only show the last day's figures on this dashboard, we can construct a time-series by looking at previous versions on web archive. Where possible we have tried to take the total test counts at the same time every day (those published at 00:30h). Unfortunately this time of publishing from CDC was not always completely consistent. This may lead to small discrepancies between 'total tested' and 'new from 'yesterday' figures. Wherever possible we took the total test count as of 00:30 as the prefered figure; where a day of data was missing we used the 'new from yesterday' figure to calculate the total for the previous day. If there are small discrepancies with other sources, this timing issue is likely to be the cause. In any case it is likely to be minor.

The date from which the total test figures date back to is not known; the CDC dashboard is unavailable in web archives prior to 21st March."

We provide the figures reported as 'persons under investigation' (PUI). PUI is the sum of confirmed cases, the number of people who tested negative, and the number of people for whom results are still pending. All three figures are reported individually from 3rd March until 31st March. From 1st April onwards, the number of people who tested negative and the number for whom results are still pending are no longer reported separately.

We have received communication from Thailand's Ministry of Health (MOH) that individuals who did not meet PUI criteria can pay out of pocket to have their samples tested, referred to as the ""non-PUI"" group. This ""non-PUI"" group is large in the context of Thailand. Daily figures are currently being consolidated by the MOH. At the moment, this ""non-PUI"" group is not reflected in our current figures."

The time series figures sum up to a number slightly higher than the cumulative figure provided for cases tested. We understand this to be equivalent to the number of individuals tested. It is unclear whether the difference between the numbers relates to a genuine distinction in the two figures between the number of indivudals tested and the number of tests performed, or if the differences are due instead to reporting delays or other unintended discrepancies.

United States - inconsistent units (COVID Tracking Project),2020-04-14,https://covidtracking.com/api/us/daily.csv,COVID Tracking Project,,3081620,9.298,146614,0.442,138651.333,0.418,COVID Tracking Project,http://covidtracking.com/,"The data are an aggregation of figures released by individual states. The Project aim to report on the number of people tested, including private labs, but not all states report their figures in this way.","This is a collaborative project launched in order to fill some of the important gaps in the testing figures being collated by the CDC.

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

States currently report testing figures in a range of different ways: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."

Daily figures are provided since 18 January. CDC suggest that figures within 7 days of the update “are incomplete because of the lag in time between when specimens are accessioned, testing is performed, and results are reported”. As such we only provide figures after this 7 day cut off.

However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results is given, along with a positive test rate. The number of 'positive tests' is equal to the number of confirmed cases.

Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests – e.g. both positive – would be added to tests of people who had five tests – e.g. three negative and two positive."

It refers to its testing data as 'samples tested', and reports confirmed cases and negative samples separately; 'sample tested' generally matches the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples (though there are occasionally some small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in this case). This would suggest that 'samples tested' is equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it's unclear whether 'negative samples' includes some instances of resampling for the same person. We therefore cannot say with certainty that these are equivalent.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples by looking at previous versions of the updated website. These daily updates extend back to 2nd March. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that as of 2nd March 1753 samples had been tested."
